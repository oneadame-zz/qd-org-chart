# qd-org-chart
Quick implementation for Google Chart's org chart.
## How it works
This project provides a text area in which to paste tab separated text. The tab separated text is parsed by column. The order of columns:

| id | Name | Title | Manager ID |

The button parses the data and draws the chart. That's it. Use the sample names.csv to demo.
